```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


#load data
```{r}
df <- read.csv("datasets/fictional_data.csv")

```

#we're gonna view the data
#View always goes with a capital V
```{r}
View(df)
```

#we wanna look at the distribution of income
#to do so we type "hist" of df (the dataset) + $ + variable "income"
```{r}
hist(df$income)
mean(df$income)
var(df$income)
sd(df$income)
```

#let's try education now

```{r}
hist(df$edu)
mean(df$edu)
var(df$edu)
sd(df$edu)
```

#and now we're gonna find confidence intervals for income and education
```{r}
upper_95 = (mean(df$income))
```

#now let's plot a lil bit

```{r}
plot(df$income,df$edu)
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
